							more engaged, they are more likely to learn and retain information. Educational
							games can encourage students to think creatively and develop innovative

							according to some research is beneficial. It enables the mind of the players 
							to be more active, especially those puzzle-based games. It helps the player to 
							come up with decisions in tight situations. A game should not be regarded as a 
							marginal activity filling in odd moments when the teacher and class have nothing 
							better to do. Games should be used at all the stages of the lesson provided that 
							they are suitable and carefully chosen. Games also lend themselves well to revision
							exercises helping learners recall material in a pleasant, Entertaining way. <br>

								Background of the study
							</p>
								Educational games are games designed with the purpose of promoting learning 
								and education. These games are specifically created to enhance the learning 
								experience of players, often by providing them with engaging and interactive 
								content that supports their cognitive development. Educational games can take 
								many forms, including board games, card games, video games, and mobile apps. 
								They can cover a wide range of subjects, including math, science, history, 
								geography, and language learning. Educational games can be a powerful tool for 
								enhancing student learning.<br>
								They provide an engaging and interactive way for 
								students to learn new concepts and skills, and can help to increase motivation 
								and interest in the subject matter. Educational games are those designed to teach 
								people about a specific subject or a specific skill. They are made predominantly 
								for kids and students of all ages, and can be used both inside the classroom and 
								out. Educational games are a subset of serious gaming. Educational games can be 
								used to teach a wide range of subjects and skills, from math and science to social 
								studies and language arts. This makes them a versatile and flexible tool for 
								teachers to use in the classroom. <br>
								Research has shown that educational games can have a positive impact on student 
								learning outcomes. Studies have found that students who use educational games 
								tend to perform better on assessments and retain more information than those who 
								do not. Educational games offer a fun and engaging way for students to learn and 
								can help to improve learning outcomes. They are a valuable tool for teachers to use 
								in the classroom and can help to make learning more accessible and enjoyable for all 
								students. Many educational games are designed to be played with others, which can 
								help students develop collaboration and social skills. <br>
								The researcher of this study felt need to find out how educational games affect 
								the Grade 12 ICT students of AMA Santa Cruz in terms of their academic performance. 
								The purpose of this study is to know if educational games has a positive or 
								negative effects on students. It has an aim to find out how educational games 
								affect the students academic performance.

							Theoretical Framework
							</p>
								According to Peña-Miguel Noemí, Sedano Hoyuelos Máximo (2014) The introduction 
								of new technologies in society has created a need for interactive contents that 
								can make the most of the potential that technological advances offer. Serious games 
								as educational games are such content: they can be defined as video games or 
								interactive applications whose main purpose is to provide not only entertainment 
								but also training in areas such as health, marketing, education, etc. This paper 
								reviews various cases of successful serious games and their influence on the 
								learning process, looks at tutoring as the key to guiding the learning process 
								throughout serious games and considers what kind of abilities and skills can be 
								achieved via such games. At this time of financial, economic and social crisis 
								citizens must be prepared to confront the challenges of the future, and the 
								individual values of each citizen must be joined to those of society as a whole. 
								Serious games are the perfect tool for achieving these aims, and for transmitting 
								contents and values. <br>
								According to Alice Kaplan Gordon (1970) Among the reasons for using games as a
								tool in education are that they motivate students, teach difficult concepts, 
								give opportunities to make decisions and solve problems, and give usually poor 
								students a change to take the lead in class. Games now available from producers, 
								most designed for use in social studies classes, are described here in detail. 
								The teacher's role in the game, especially in the important debriefing session, 
								where lessons of the game are made explicit, is explained. Suggestions for 
								designing games and adapting existing games to new situations are given. 
								A section on evaluating the learning impact of games notes that while games 
								are not more effective than other teaching methods, they often teach processes, 
								rather than facts, and they are just about the only medium teaching this. 
								A supplementary section describes games for exploring attitudes of students, 
								teachers, and community mem Among the reasons for using games as a tool in

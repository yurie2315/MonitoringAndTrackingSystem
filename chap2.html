								Foreign literature

                            A study done with Kindergarteners Din & Calao, (2001) Showed that students 
                            who played educational online games on the Sony Light span, which is a game 
                            system similar to the Sony PlayStation One, made significant increases over 
                            the control group in the learning of spelling and reading; however, no 
                            significant gain was made over the control group in math. This suggests a 
                            facilitative role of playing online games in developing verbal skills 
                            (2001). Smyth (2007) suggested that complex games may lead to academic success 
                            by engaging players in problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity. <br>
                            According to Birgit Schmitz, Roland Klemke, Marcus Specht(2012) within the past 
                            decade, a growing number of educational scientists have started to recognise 
                            the multifaceted potential that mobile learning games have as a tool for 
                            learning and teaching. This paper presents a review of current research on the 
                            topic to better understand game mechanisms with regard to learning outcomes. 
                            The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a framework of analysis 
                            which is based on previous work on game design patterns for mobile games and on 
                            learning outcomes. The framework focuses on two aspects, motivation and knowledge 
                            gain. Second, we present a set of patterns which we identified in the literature 
                            and that positively influence these two aspects. Our results support the general 
                            assumption that mobile learning games have potential to enhance motivation. 
                            It reveals that game mechnisms such as Collaborative Actions or Augmented Reality 
                            provide incentive to get engaged with learning and/or a certain topic. With regard 
                            to knowledge gain, results are less comprehensive. <br>
                            According to Lina Lafta Jassim, Hisham Dzakiria(2019) Digital games play a 
                            significant role in the life of the new generation. Although there are many 
                            criticisms, many studies focus on the importance of digital games in improving 
                            learner’s vocabulary in the target language. Researchers have begun conducting 
                            several researches on how using games in the class can foster vocabulary learning. 
                            The aim of this paper is to investigate the impacts of digital games on children’s 
                            vocabulary learning depending on a literature review. Many studies focus on the 
                            impacts of digital games on different aspects of education.

								Local literature
							</p>
                            According to the study of “Mixed Up E-games”, (Michael Detablan., et. Al, 
                            ACLC Taguig October 2013) the project has different categories: different 
                            shapes, math games, colouring games, typing games and more. By creating various 
                            games that are fun yet educational, kids can learn skills like problem-solving 
                            and boosting creativity so they’ll have advance learning before they go to school. 
                            Parents also benefit from it since they don’t have to persuade their children to 
                            learn new things. By letting the kids play educational games, they will be able 
                            to acquire new skills or improve what they already have. <br>
                            According to the article “The gamification of education Why playing is the future 
                            of learning” by Michael Logarta (June 11, 2014), students can benefit more in 
                            gamification of education rather than using traditional way of educating students. 
                            Gamification means using game mechanics to make teaching more interesting, 
                            motivating, casual and fun for students. So instead of restricting them from 
                            playing games, why not use certain games that can increase their knowledge, 
                            memorization and skills. Also, if lessons are given in a game-like manner, 
                            students would tend to remember it more than lectures that are stated in a 
                            news-like manner <br>
                            According to the article “Mobile Learning” by Baran, Evrim (2014)Mobile devices 
                            have become attractive learning devices for education. While the majority of the
                            existing research has focused primarily on the value of mobile learning for 
                            students, researchers have recently started exploring its potentials within 
                            teacher development. The present qualitative synthesis of quantitative and 
                            qualitative research aimed to address trends and gaps observed in the literature
                            regarding the integration of mobile learning into teacher education. Six main 
                            findings emergeda) there is an increasing trend in integrating mobile learning 
                            in teacher education contexts; (b)theoretical and conceptual perspectives are 
                            scarcely reported; (c) variations exist in perceptions, attitudes and usage 
                            patterns; (d) engagement with mobile learning and devices is primarily reported 
                            as being beneficial; € challenges were scarcely reported; and (f) several 
                            pedagogical affordances support mobile learning integration into teacher education 
                            settings. These finding shave been interpreted to determine their implications on 
                            the development of mobile learning experiences in teacher education, including 
                            programmatic directions for integration and study.

								Are games effective learning tools?
							</p>
                            According to Sara De Freitas(2018) The literature around the use, efficacy and 
                            design of educational games and game-based learning approaches has been building 
                            up gradually and in phases, across different disciplines and in an ad hoc way. 
                            This has been problematic in a number of ways and resulted in fragmented literature 
                            and inconsistent referencing patterns between different sub-disciplines and 
                            countries. This is mainly because no distinct single-disciplinary perspective 
                            has emerged because of: the cross-disciplinary nature of educational games, a 
                            reliance on single-disciplinary contexts for studies, changing terminologies in 
                            different contexts and the use of multi-methodological approaches. Distinct 
                            perspectives from education science, game science, neuroscience and information 
                            science have deepened our understanding of play and games. This research has 
                            become more quantitative, rigorous and nuanced as a result of more studies 
                            focused upon therapeutic health applications of games, the serious games research 
                            movement and more efficacy and comparative studies that examine and quantify

								Games For Growth; Educational Games in the Classroom
							</p>
                            According to Alice Kaplan Gordon(1970) among the reasons for using games as a 
                            tool in education are that they motivate students, teach difficult concepts, 
                            give opportunities to make decisions and solve problems, and give usually poor 
                            students a change to take the lead in class. Games now available from producers, 
                            most designed for use in social studies classes, are described here in detail. 
                            The teacher's role in the game, especially in the important debriefing session, 
                            where lessons of the game are made explicit, is explained. Suggestions for 
                            designing games and adapting existing games to new situations are given. 
                            A section on evaluating the learning impact of games notes that while games 
                            are not more effective than other teaching methods, they often teach processes, 
                            rather than facts, and they are just about the only medium teaching this. 
                            A supplementary section describes games for exploring attitudes of students, 
                            teachers, and community members.

								Exploring Philippine Traditional Games as Motivational Activities for Learning
							</p>
                            According to Tupas, Fernan P.; Palmares, Ma. Theresa G(2018) this study aimed 
                            to explore the possibility of tapping traditional games as motivational 
                            activities that can aid in the teaching of the sciences in the K-12 curriculum 
                            and eventually will help learners increase their interest as well as performance 
                            in science. Method: This study is a qualitative research that aims to gather 
                            an in-depth understanding of science ideas, concepts and practices in Philippine 
                            traditional games. The purposively selected respondents of this study were 
                            comprised of the top 1 pupils and students from Grades 3 to Grade 10 from various 
                            schools. The respondents were invited every weekend to play one traditional game, 
                            and to observe their classmates and friends play during free time. These students 
                            were interviewed using the conversation analysis method wherein the Hiligaynon 
                            dialect was translated into English. This was tape recorded and responses 
                            related to science were extracted and triangulated and then were themed into 
                            four major science topics such as Earth Science, Biology, Chemistry and Physics. 
                            Findings: The study found that scientific ideas and concepts were embedded in 
                            the Philippine traditional games and can be used as instructional materials in 
                            teaching and learning science in K - 12 Basic Education Program of the Department 
                            of Education. With the inclusion of these traditional games, learners will become 
                            more interested in learning science. Significance: An instructional material using 
                            traditional games was formulated to be used in teaching science curriculum in 
                            basic education program. This is to help below average learners understand and 
                            appreciate science learning.
